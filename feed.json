So she knew a little of that, enough to defend herself, but no more. But she hadn't known about her grandmother... nor had her mother.</p>\n\n<p data-start=\"132\" data-end=\"343\"><br>Aria's mother, Cassia, had been ill for so long that Aria barely remembered a time when she hadn’t been weak and pale, coughing fits wracking her frame until she was bedridden for days at a time. Her father had always looked worried, always seemed to be in some degree of pain when he saw Cassia like that. But Jirotav, it turned out, had actually been the reason for his own wife's illness. All because she had once threatened to leave him, to take Aria with her after a fight of trivial significance.<br><br>Jirotav had always been a selfish and possessive man, the way some hoard wealth or power. He clung to Cassia not out of love, but out of a need to own, to control. He would have burned the world down just so she had nowhere else to go but back to him.<br><br>Aria's grandfather, Septimus, had been a different kind of man. He, too, had been fierce, a force of nature unto himself. But where Jirotav’s love had been a cage, Septimus’s had been a shield. If Juliana, his wife, had ever asked for the world, he would have burned it to <strong>bring</strong> it to her feet, not to trap her within it.<br><br>That was the difference.<br><br>And that was why, when Juliana died, Septimus had become something terrible.<br><br>Jirotav had underestimated the sweet, older woman who was Aria’s grandmother. He had assumed that because her husband barely let her out of his sight, she was powerless. That she would never find out what he had done to Cassia. But she did. And more than that—she confronted him. She threatened to take Cassia and Aria away if he didn’t stop. <br><br>That was why she had to die.<br><br>Jirotav made it seem like a tragic accident, a cruel twist of fate that not even her husband would suspect. And he might have gotten away with it, too, if it weren’t for one thing: Juliana had been careful. She had left a letter within a stuffed toy she gave Aria soon after her confrontation with Jirotav, explaining everything.<br><br>Aria mourned her grandmother, but her grandfather had been inconsolable. He had gone from a vibrant, active man to a hellstorm of death and destruction. Septimus had once been a Spellsword of the Legendary skill. He had traveled all over Cyrodiil, slaying and destroying as he both commanded and pleased. Only Juliana had tamed the beast, only she had quieted the fire that burned in him. It had been her music that had calmed him, her kisses that had soothed him. And now that she was gone, there was nothing to hold him back.<br><br>He nearly destroyed the Imperial City itself as he meticulously dissected and annihilated the entirety of the underworld in search of answers—because he had no doubts. Someone had murdered his beloved, and he would find them. But even as years passed, even as his daughter begged him to stop, he wouldn’t. Perhaps he couldn’t. And eventually, Cassia succumbed to her illness.<br><br>That was when he found the letter.<br><br>Juliana had left it in the one place she knew he would find it. She hadn’t thought it would take him years to visit her vanity, to finally touch her things again. But once he did…<br><br>There was no stopping what came next.</p>",

I encountered more issues than I care to admit—ranging from internal links to formatting quirks and learning how Publii handles themes. To this day, I’m not entirely satisfied with the theme options, but troubleshooting these issues has deepened my understanding of how different web development tools interact.</p>\n<h4 data-start=\"1162\" data-end=\"1197\"><strong data-start=\"1167\" data-end=\"1195\">Design &amp; Styling Choices</strong></h4>\n<p data-start=\"1198\" data-end=\"1364\">I wanted my site to have a clean but slightly personal aesthetic, so I adjusted the <strong data-start=\"1282\" data-end=\"1316\">colors, typography, and layout</strong> to reflect that. Some key decisions included:</p>\n<ul data-start=\"1365\" data-end=\"1575\">\n<li data-start=\"1365\" data-end=\"1451\">Using <strong data-start=\"1373\" data-end=\"1396\">dusk rose (#E89DA6)</strong> as an accent color for a soft but distinctive touch.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1452\" data-end=\"1510\">Keeping a <strong data-start=\"1464\" data-end=\"1491\">stacked vertical layout</strong> for multi-platform readability and consistency.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1511\" data-end=\"1575\">Customizing the navigation and buttons to enhance usability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-start=\"1577\" data-end=\"1798\">One of the trickiest parts was ensuring that everything looked good across different devices. Mobile testing revealed some unexpected formatting issues, but tweaking the formatting, styles and adjusting layouts helped resolve them.</p>\n<h4 data-start=\"1800\" data-end=\"1839\"><strong data-start=\"1805\" data-end=\"1837\">Key Takeaways &amp; Future Plans</strong></h4>\n<p data-start=\"1840\" data-end=\"2086\">Building this portfolio was a great learning experience, and I’ve already made a mental list of improvements for the future. I’d love to add a <strong data-start=\"1983\" data-end=\"2011\">dark/light mode switcher</strong> and implement <strong data-start=\"2026\" data-end=\"2050\">multilingual support</strong> to make the site more accessible.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2088\" data-end=\"2281\">For now, though, the focus is on refining my <strong data-start=\"2133\" data-end=\"2155\">Projects &amp; Samples</strong> section to better showcase my work. After all, the portfolio exists to highlight my skills, and it’s time to put it to use!</p>",
